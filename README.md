tp_autotune - because naming things is hard.

The goal of this ~~project~~ total hack is to take data from [Tidepool](https://tidepool.org) and make it usable by the [Autotune](https://github.com/openaps/docs/blob/master/docs/docs/Customize-Iterate/autotune.md) feature from [oref0](https://github.com/openaps/oref0). It currently does this in probably the worst ways possible (if it works at all), but it has very lofty dreams of someday becoming a genuinely useful thing.

This comes with no warranty nor guarantee of accuracy, efficiency, or... well anything really.

This tool currently assumes that you have a `json` dump of your Tidepool data (using [command-line-data-tools](https://github.com/tidepool-org/command-line-data-tools) or the like) _AND_ have the [Docker](https://docker.com) container [`pazaan/oref0`](https://hub.docker.com/r/pazaan/openaps/) installed. You can use the `-d/--no-docker` flag to use a globally installed copy of `oref0` instead of the Docker container.

Usage (if you dare):
```
yarn tune --start-date <YYYY-MM-DD> --end-date <YYYY-MM-DD> --source <path to `json` dump>
```

This will generate a _lot_ of files in a `data` directory that vaguely mirror the files that would be generated by [`oref0-autotune`](https://github.com/openaps/oref0/blob/master/bin/oref0-autotune.sh) and, if you're very very lucky, will spit out the proper output from Autotune.
